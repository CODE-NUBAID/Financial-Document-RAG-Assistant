> **A Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that answers questions about invoices — grounded strictly in the document, with citations, structured data extraction, and a real evaluation harness.**

Upload one or more invoice PDFs and ask questions in plain language. Every answer is traceable back to the exact page and chunk it came from — no hallucination, no guessing.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Most "ask your PDF" demos stop at a single document and a single free-text answer. InvoiceAI goes further:

- **Multiple invoices in one session** — ask cross-document questions, not just single-PDF Q&A
- **Page-level citations** — every answer names the source file, page number, and a relevance score
- **Structured field extraction** — a separate JSON-mode call pulls vendor, totals, dates, and invoice numbers into clean structured data, not just sentences
- **A real evaluation harness** — measures retrieval accuracy and answer accuracy *separately*, plus latency, instead of one vague "it works" check
- **Honest engineering** — relevance scores are labeled as retrieval heuristics, not fabricated confidence percentages; known limitations are documented, not hidden

## 🧠 RAG Pipeline

```text
PDF Upload(s)
     │
     ▼
Page-Level Text Extraction (PyPDFLoader)
     │
     ▼
Metadata Tagging (source file + page number)
     │
     ▼
Chunking (500 chars, 100 overlap)
     │
     ▼
Embeddings (Gemini Embedding API)
     │
     ▼
FAISS Vector Index (merge-able across multiple PDFs)
     │
     ▼
User Query
     │
     ▼
Similarity Search → Top-K Chunks + Relevance Scores
     │
     ▼
Anti-Hallucination Prompt (context + question)
     │
     ▼
Gemini LLM
     │
     ▼
Answer + Page Citations + Excerpts

A second, independent path handles structured extraction:

Full Document Text → JSON-Schema Prompt → Gemini → Parsed JSON Fields
```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Category | Technology |
|---|---|
| Language | Python |
| Web Framework | Flask |
| RAG Framework | LangChain |
| Vector Database | FAISS |
| LLM | Gemini 2.5 Flash (Google Generative AI) |
| Embeddings | Gemini Embedding API |
| PDF Processing | PyPDF |
| Frontend | Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS |

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/invoice-ai
cd invoice-ai
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

**Windows**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux / macOS**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure your Gemini API key

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:
```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Get a free key at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/).

### 5. Run it

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## 🧪 Running the Evaluation Harness

```bash
python evaluation.py uploads/your_invoice.pdf
```

This measures three separate things, not one pass/fail number:

```text
Retrieval Hit Rate : did FAISS retrieve the chunk containing the right answer?
Answer Accuracy    : did the final LLM answer contain the correct value?
Avg Latency        : how long retrieval + generation took, per question
```

> **Important:** the test cases in `evaluation.py` contain placeholder expected values. Before running it on your own invoice, open the PDF and update `TEST_CASES` with the real vendor name, invoice number, total, and due date from *that specific document*. An evaluation script is only as honest as its ground truth — this is a deliberate design choice, not an oversight.

A detailed JSON report is saved to `eval_report.json` after each run.

---

## 💬 Example Queries

```text
What is the invoice number?
What is the total amount due?
Who is the vendor?
What is the due date?
List all line items.
What are the payment terms?
```

---

## 📌 Example Response

```text
Question: What is the total amount due?

Answer: The total amount due is ₹1,91,129.90.

Citation:
  File: invoice.pdf · Page 1 · Relevance: 87%
  Excerpt: "TOTAL DUE: ₹1,91,129.90"
```

If the answer isn't in the document:
```text
Answer: Not found in document.
```

## 🧩 Core Components

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `PyPDFLoader` | Extracts page-level text and attaches source metadata |
| `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` | Splits text into overlapping chunks, preserving metadata |
| `GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` | Converts text chunks into vectors |
| `FAISS` | Stores vectors, supports merging multiple documents into one index |
| `retrieve_chunks()` | Similarity search + relevance scoring |
| `answer_query()` | Builds the grounded prompt, calls Gemini, attaches citations |
| `extract_invoice_fields()` | Separate structured-output call returning strict JSON |
| `evaluation.py` | Measures retrieval and answer accuracy independently |

---

## ⚠️ Error Handling

The application handles:

- ❌ Missing or invalid API key
- ❌ Missing or non-PDF file uploads
- ❌ Empty user queries
- ❌ No relevant context retrieved
- ❌ Malformed JSON from structured extraction (parsed defensively, fails gracefully)
- ❌ Gemini API rate limits (429) — mitigated with per-IP rate limiting so one visitor can't exhaust the shared quota for everyone

---

## 🎯 Key Engineering Decisions (and why)

- **Relevance score, not "confidence"** — the UI shows a retrieval relevance percentage derived from FAISS distance. It is explicitly *not* presented as a calibrated probability, because it isn't one. Honesty about what a metric actually measures matters more than a more impressive-looking number.
- **Two separate LLM call patterns** — free-text grounded Q&A (RAG) and structured JSON extraction are implemented as two distinct code paths, because they're solving two different problems with two different prompting strategies.
- **In-memory session state** — no database is used; each visitor's FAISS index and document state live in a server-side dictionary. This is a deliberate simplicity tradeoff for a single-instance portfolio deployment, not a production-scale design, and is documented here rather than hidden.
- **Evaluation measures two failure modes separately** — a wrong final answer can mean either "retrieval found the wrong chunk" or "retrieval was right but the LLM misread it." Measuring `retrieval_hit` and `answer_correct` independently makes it possible to tell which failure actually occurred.

---

## 🔒 Known Limitations

- No persistent database — FAISS indexes reset on server restart
- No authentication or multi-tenant isolation beyond per-session cookies
- Relevance scoring is a heuristic, not a calibrated confidence metric
- Evaluation test cases must be manually written per document — there is no automated ground-truth generation

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- OCR support for scanned (non-text) invoices
- Multi-invoice comparison ("which invoice has the highest amount?")
- Automated test-case generation from document content
- Persistent storage layer for session state across restarts
- Bring-your-own-API-key support for public deployments

---

## 📚 What This Project Demonstrates

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture end-to-end
- Prompt engineering for hallucination prevention with a defined fallback behavior
- Vector embeddings and FAISS similarity search, including incremental index merging
- Structured output / JSON-mode prompting as a distinct pattern from free-text generation
- RAG evaluation methodology — separating retrieval accuracy from generation accuracy
- Flask API design with session-scoped state and per-IP rate limiting
- Frontend engineering without a framework — modular CSS/JS, dark mode via CSS variables, localStorage-backed state
